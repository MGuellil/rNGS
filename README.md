rNGS
====

**Experimental** R code to drive BWA and SAMtools

Under active development likely to change and break often, highly specialised to my own data.

Install at your own risk with [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) thus...

```{R}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rNGS", "teasdalm")
library("rNGS")
```
